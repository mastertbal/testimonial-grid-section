            <p class="first-p">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned
            were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly
            feel I got every penny's worth.
            </p>
            <p class="second-p">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have 
            heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it 
            incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - 
            time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a 
            Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="first-p">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="second-p">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure 
            fromprofessionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a formerstudent 
            of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staffdid not disappoint. 
            They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile teamproject, in particular, was 
            . It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorialcould ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to 
            it during interviews as an example of my developentexperience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack 
            developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommend! ”</p>

            <p class="second-p"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really 
            refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and 
            present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the 
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ” </p>
